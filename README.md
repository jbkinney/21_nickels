# Analysis code and summary data

**Structural and mechanistic basis of Ïƒ-dependent transcriptional pausing**

The computational pipeline used in this study was split into three steps: 

1. Step 1: `01_step_fastq_to_feature`: 
    - This component run on the `Elzar` High Performance Computing Cluster at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). 

    - Scripts provides in this directory was configured specifically for the `Elzar` cluster at CSHL, and will likely have to be modified before it is run on a different cluster. 
    - To run this pipeline, first we need all `fastq` sequencing data and deposit them into the directory `/01_step_fastq_to_feature/fastq` directory. 
    - The output of this step is called `feature` files which are explained in details in the `Step 2`. 

2. Step 2: `02_step_feature_to_final_dataframes`:
    - The scripts provided for the second step run on the `Elzar` High Performance Computing Cluster at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). However, any machine with adequte computational resorurces would be able to run them.

    - We added the step-by-step guidline in the README file inside the directory.

    - The input of these steps are the `feature` files from step 1. In addition, for ligation and cross-link bias correction one need to provide the appropriate data from anlysis of the XACT_seq (2020) paper below. For convenince, the dataframe used for bias correction from XACT_seq (2020) is provided. 
    
    [Winkelman, Jared T., et al. "XACT-seq comprehensively defines the promoter-position and promoter-sequence determinants for initial-transcription pausing." Molecular cell 79.5 (2020): 797-811.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.07.006)
   
    - The outpur of this step are:
        - Template, ligation and crosslink bias corrected pause elements and A-site for each replicate.
        - Global sequence logos for each replicate.
        - Rescaled values for count after bias corrections for each replicates.
        - Raw pause elements, A-site dataframes for each replicates.

 3. Step 3: `03_step_final_dataframe_to_logos`
    - The scripts provided in this step plot logos for both current, and XACT_seq (2020) experiments. 
    - The content of this folder is standalone and one should be easily reproduce all the sequence logos. Note that the scripts depend on popular scientific python packages like `numpy, pandas` and `matplotlib`. In addition, for sequence logos we used the Python package [logomaker](https://logomaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - Scripts are provided in the form of `jupyter-notebook`s.
    - The details of how we get the global/averge logos are provided as well.
    - These script can be easily executed on the local machine[
